# Open Source and Community Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our
open source projects and communities (community programs), as well as the consequences
for unacceptable behaviour. We invite all those who participate to help us create safe
and positive experiences for everyone. Communities mirror the societies in which they
exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and
abuses of power that exist in society.

## How to behave

The following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration, respect and empathy in your speech and actions. Remember, we have all been through different
  stages of learning when adopting technologies.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.
- Disagreements on things are fine, argumentative behaviour or trolling are not.

## How not to behave

- Do not perform threats of violence or use violent language directed against another person.
- Do not make jokes of sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory nature, or use
  language of this nature.
- Do not post or display sexually explicit or violent material.
- Do not post or threaten to post other peopleâ€™s personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Do not make personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Do not engage in sexual attention. This includes, sexualised comments or jokes and sexual advances.
- Do not advocate for, or encourage, any of the above behaviour.

Please take into account that online communities bring together people from many
different cultures and backgrounds. It's important to understand that sometimes
the combination of cultural differences and online interaction can lead to misunderstandings.
That is why having empathy is very important.
